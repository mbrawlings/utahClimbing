                    <p>Most climbers would agree that American Fork Canyon isn't the prettiest rock to climb on.
                        The atmosphere also isn't the top of it's class. However, the sheer quantity of developed
                        routes helps it make our top 5. The history behind this canyon is riveting. It comes
                        a unique, powerful style that keeps climbers coming back for more.

                    <p>Maple Canyon has over 550 developed routes that range between 5.4 and 5.14+ in difficulty and 
                        the rock consists of cobblestone-sized conglomerate from the cliff.
                        The majority of the routes are just a short walk from your car or your campsite. This is often
                        a popular summer crag because of the amount of shade that the narrow canyons provide.

                    <p>Most of the sport climbing here is sandstone with a few limestone crags to the south and the west.
                        Because of the intense summer heat, most climbers find that fall to spring are the best conditions.
                        The colors of these walls range fron yellow, to red, to black, to white all depending on the area.
                        As a whole, this area is very diverse in it's climbing style and rock features.

                    <p>This is one of the smaller areas we have listed on this page, however, the quality and style is one
                        of a kind. The rock consists of a very compact sandstone/quartzite. Because of this area's 7500ft altitude 
                        and that most of the climbs are just on the outside of a narrow creek, generally climbers can climb here 
                        even when Moab might be too hot to bear. Although this is a smaller area, it still offers overhung, slab,
                        roof, and vertical climbing.

                    <p>The Uintas area is a sport climbers saving grace when it's too hot in the valley. With an elevation of
                        over 11,100ft, this crag is climbable all summer long. The areas up here don't get near as crowded as 
                        some of the lower elevation crags because of the further drive and hike in.

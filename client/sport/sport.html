                    <p>Most climbers would agree that American Fork Canyon isn't the prettiest rock to climb on.
                        The atmosphere also isn't the top of it's class. However, the sheer quantity of developed
                        routes helps it make our top 5. The history behind this canyon is riveting. It comes
                        a unique, powerful style that keeps climbers coming back for more.
